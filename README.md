# World CLock Application built with a JavaScript Library

This weather application uses the Moment.js library to pull real-time timezone data and display it in the interface I built.

## Project goals and features

The aim of this project was to build a compact, functional and beautiful clock application using a JavaScript library. Styled dynamically with my personal UI/UX design style, this project was also deployed and is live hosted by Netlify.

### A massive vote of thanks to SheCodes and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) for enabling me with this amazing learning opportunity.
